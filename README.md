# Project_3_App
Mood tracker app

This app allows users to answer several simple questions aimed at encouraging mindfulness while storing mood data for later reference. In order to make the user's process simple and finite, I have limited users to completing the question cycle once a day. I intentionally do not currently have a method for users to view their data from previous days, in order to encourage a fresh mindset every day. I would like to add components of statistical analysis down the line so the user can see their averages mood ratings, trends, descriptive word frequency, correlations between words and mood numbers, after a period of time (two months).

To add:
-username and password specifications requiring a unique username and a password of x characters
-back button in react or navigation tab among the components
-more succinct styling to home page, including check marks on completed days
-limitation on number entry to ensure the number is between one and ten, or a list of numbers keyed to an associated number value rather than an input field
-progress bar to show how far along the route the user is

User stories:
Can user register?
Can user log in?
Can user answer series of questions, navigating using "next button?"
Can user only access "check in" button once a day?
