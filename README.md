# Project_3_App
Mood tracker app

This app will allow users to answer several simple questions aimed at encouraging mindfulness while storing mood data for later reference. I would like to establish a time limit on data collection so the user can access their info only after a significant amount of data has been collected, in order to encourage the user to approach each day with a fresh attitude. I would like to add components of statistical analysis down the line so the user can see their averages mood ratings, trends, descriptive word frequency, correlations between words and mood numbers, after a period of time (two months).
